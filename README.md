## Description

Through the use of IEX's API, we can obtain stock quotes by providing a stock's ticker symbol. After registering for an account, a user can log in and is given a fake $10,000 to spend. This investment can be used to buy/sell stocks and observe their values fluctuate over time since IEX provides us with real time prices.
