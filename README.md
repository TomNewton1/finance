## Description

This web application is built using the **flask framework, Python, HTML and Bootstrap**. The application makes use of the **IEX API** to get real-time stock values. After registering for an account users are then able to get a quote, buy or sell a stock and build a portfolio that changes in value over time. An **SQL database** is used to store information such as username, password hash, the stocks they bought or sold and the history of transactions. 

Users start with a fake $10,000 to spend.
